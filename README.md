# Magen Israel Frontend

A modern, mobile-friendly React app for real-time Home Front Command alerts in Israel.

## Features

- Last update time and instructions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Backend server running (see ../magen_israel_be_nest)

### Install dependencies

npm install
```

### Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### API/Backend Configuration
- The frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:3939` (default).
- To change the backend URL, edit the `SOCKET_URL` in `src/hooks/useAlertSocket.ts`.
- REST API and WebSocket requests are proxied via Vite config for local development.

```

```bash
npm run preview
```
